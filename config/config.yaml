  # 🕐 Push Time Window Control (Optional Feature)
  # Purpose: Limit the time range for pushes to avoid disturbances during non-working hours
  # Use Cases:
  #   - Only want to receive pushes during weekday working hours (e.g., 09:00-18:00)
  #   - Want to receive a summary at a fixed time in the evening (e.g., 20:00-22:00)
  push_window:
    enabled: false # Enable push time window control, default is off
    # Note: GitHub Actions execution time is unstable, it is recommended to leave at least a 2-hour window
    # For precise scheduled pushes, it is recommended to deploy with Docker on a personal server
    time_range:
      start: "20:00" # Push window start time (local time)
      end: "22:00" # Push window end time (local time)
    once_per_day: true # Push only once per day within the time window. If false, push every time the script is executed within the window.
    push_record_retention_days: 7 # Number of days to retain push records
